[ComplexHeatmap](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ComplexHeatmap.html): powerful tool for creating beautiful heatmaps in R  

## General coding and bioinformatics
[Starting with HPC, general tips](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009207): Article published in PLOS Computational with usefull skills and general etiquette for using HPC  

## Workflow Management Systems

### Snakemake  
[Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a friendly workflow management system. 
It allows for construction of reproducible and automatic data analysis pipelines that can be easily
transferred between different working environments (cluster, cloud environment etc.). It uses Python 
based language.
